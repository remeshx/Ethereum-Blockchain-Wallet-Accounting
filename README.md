# Ethereum Blockchain Wallet Accounting
This project generates a wallet for each user and monitors each wallet for ETH or Token deposits and withdrawals. When it receives data, it updates the wallet and sends a notification of the changes to a specified server as a listener.
The project has been designed to support the ETH and USDT tokens, but it may do the same for any other token by adding it to the config file.
